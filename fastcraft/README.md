------------------------------ **FASTCRAFT** ------------------------------\
\
This addon is very similar to the Ashita Fastcraft addon. It will allow
to remove synthesis delays, but prevents skill-ups from occuring.
This will still allow you to see what item is being synthesized though
as I know there is an occurence of where the item is being printed to
the log in other versions; this one should display normally.

---------------------------- **THINGS TO NOTE** -----------------------------\
COMMANDS\
*//fast on* or *//fast off* or *//fast toggle*\
\
*It will run normal speed on breaks.*\
*You can change the font color on Line: 6 with a number 1-255*

------------------------------- **UPDATED** -------------------------------\
*Added quality to chat log at the start of synthesis.*
