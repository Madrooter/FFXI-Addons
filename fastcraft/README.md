------------------------------ FASTCRAFT ------------------------------\
\
This addon is very similar to the Ashita Fastcraft addon. It will allow
to remove synthesis delays, but prevents skill-ups from occuring.
This will still allow you to see what item is being synthesized though
as I know there is an occurence of where the item is being printed to
the log in other versions; this one should display normally.
